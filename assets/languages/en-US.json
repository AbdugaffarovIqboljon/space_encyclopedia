  "mercury_funny_fact" : "Mercury's day is longer than its year! A day on Mercury takes about 59 Earth days, while its year takes only about 88 Earth days.",
  "venus_funny_fact" : "Venus rotates in the opposite direction compared to most planets. It has a 'retrograde' rotation, so if you stood on Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east.",
  "earth_funny_fact" : "Earth is the only planet known to have chocolate. Well, not exactly, but we do have cacao trees, and that's a start \uD83D\uDE05!",
  "mars_funny_fact" : "Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system called Olympus Mons. It's so big that if you stood on its summit, you wouldn't even realize you're on a volcano – it's that gently sloped!",
  "jupiter_funny_fact" : "Jupiter's massive size is so impressive that it could fit all the other planets in the solar system inside it with room to spare – it's like the ultimate planetary party host.",
